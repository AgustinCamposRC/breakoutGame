# breakoutGame
My own version of the atari game breakout, which is ba around a lsedayer of bricks that line up the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball on a paddle against them.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is relatively simple. The user has 3 tries or lives to play. If the ball goes below the bottom of the screen and misses the paddle, they lose a life. To win, the user must break all the bricks on the screen.

## Speed Ball
The speed of the ball increases with each vertical bounce that the ball makes with the paddle or with a brick.
